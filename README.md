# Bare-Bones Web Application

This is a minimal web application with a simple structure that you can modify and build upon.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or later recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js) or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd [repository-name]
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   or if you're using yarn:
   ```
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the Application

To start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```
or with yarn:
```
yarn dev
```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is already in use).

### Building for Production

To create a production build:

```
npm run build
```
or with yarn:
```
yarn build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.

## Project Structure
