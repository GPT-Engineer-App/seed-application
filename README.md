# Vite React Project

This is a bare-bones web application built with Vite and React. It provides a simple structure that you can modify and build upon.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* You have installed the latest version of [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Installing and Running the Project

To install and run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd vite-project
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is already in use).

## Building for Production

To build the app for production, run:

```
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` folder with all the built files.

## Additional Commands

- `npm run lint`: Run ESLint to check for code quality and style issues
- `npm run preview`: Preview the production build locally

## Modifying the Project

This is a bare-bones application designed to be easily modified. Feel free to add new components, styles, or functionality as needed. The main entry point of the application is `src/main.jsx`, and the main component is in `src/App.jsx`.
